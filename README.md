# Whoops, your elytra is gone!
You died, you hope you can recover your stuff, you get your armor but something's missing - an elytra you worked so hard for! That's what this mod does, it deletes every elytra present in your inventory when you die.
A bonus feature however is that you can configure the chance of an elytra spawning in an end ship, kinda cool isn't it?

# HUGE NOTE HERE : This mod was created for a friend in like what? 4-5 hours, bugs may happen, if they do, just report them.
